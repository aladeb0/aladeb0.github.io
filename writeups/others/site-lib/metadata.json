The challenge title hints strongly at an XSS vulnerability related to cookies. A search box was identified as the primary user input. Entering a test string (e.g., test) showed the input being reflected directly onto the page. Viewing the page source revealed the critical detail: the user input was inserted within an existing &lt;script&gt; block in the DOM. document.write('&lt;img src=\"/images/' + user_input + '\"/&gt;'); This indicated a DOM-based XSS vulnerability where we could break out of the JavaScript string and inject arbitrary code. The goal was to close the existing &lt;script&gt; tag and start a new one to execute our code. Initial Attempt: Simply closing the script string and statement with '};alert(1) failed, as the input was still being treated as data within the original script. Successful Payload: The solution was to close the entire &lt;script&gt; tag itself and define a new one: Payload: &lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt; This payload successfully terminated the original script block and created a new, attacker-controlled script block. The crafted payload was entered into the search box and submitted.\nA JavaScript alert popped up, displaying the contents of document.cookie.\nThe flag was contained within the cookie value.\nFlag: [The flag would be displayed in the alert box]This challenge demonstrated a classic DOM-based XSS attack. The key to exploitation was understanding the context of the injection (inside a &lt;script&gt; tag) and using the correct method to escape that context (&lt;/script&gt; tag closure) rather than just escaping the JavaScript string. Proper output encoding and the use of Content Security Policy (CSP) are effective mitigations against such attacks.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>[Room Name: Searching for the Cookie] - Write-up</strong>","level":3,"id":"**[Room_Name_Searching_for_the_Cookie]_-_Write-up**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>1.
