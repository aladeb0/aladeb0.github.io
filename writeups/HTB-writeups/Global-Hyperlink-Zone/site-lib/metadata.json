analyze.The server implements a quantum circuit simulator using Qiskit with specific constraints:\nclass Hyperlink: def __init__(self): self.backend = Aer.get_backend(\"qasm_simulator\")\nInstructions must follow the format: gate:params separated by semicolons\nSingle-qubit gates: H:0, X:1, S:2, T:3 Two-qubit gates: CX:0,1, CY:1,2, CZ:2,3 5 qubits available (indexed 0-4) The circuit must produce measurement results where:\nshares[0] == shares[1] == shares[3]\nshares[2] == shares[4]\nshares[4] != shares[0]\nNo share can be all 0s or all 255s bytes\nBefore connecting to the remote server, I created a Python script to test different gate sequences locally:\n# test_hyperlink.py\nfrom server import Hyperlink def test_sequence(sequence): print(f\"\\nTesting sequence: {sequence}\") hyperlink = Hyperlink() result = hyperlink.initialize_hyperlink(sequence) print(f\"Result: {result}\") return result # Test various sequences\nsequences = [ \"H:0;CX:0,1;CX:0,3;H:2;CX:2,4\",

qubit produces a 256-bit string (0s and 1s) This string is converted to 32 bytes For shares to be equal, the measurement patterns must be identical To make shares identical, the corresponding qubits must be:\nEntangled (for perfect correlation) In the same basis state after measurement Strategy: Create two independent Bell pairs\nEntangle qubits 0, 1, and 3 together\nEntangle qubits 2 and 4 together separately\nCircuit Design:\nQubit 0: Put in superposition with Hadamard gate Qubit 1: Entangle with qubit 0 using CNOT Qubit 3: Entangle with qubit 0 using CNOT Qubit 2: Put in different superposition state Qubit 4: Entangle with qubit 2 using CNOT After testing, the winning sequence was confirmed as: H:0;CX:0,1;CX:0,3;H:2;CX:2,4\nStep-by-step explanation:\nH:0 - Puts qubit 0 into superposition (|+⟩ state)\nCX:0,1 - Creates Bell pair between qubits 0 and 1\nCX:0,3 - Entangles qubit 3 with the same system\nH:2 - Puts qubit 2 into superposition (independent of first group)\nCX:2,4 - Creates Bell pair between qubits 2 and 4 nc 94.237.56.99 37977\n<br><img alt=\"2026-02-01_14-24.png\" src=\"images/2026-02-01_14-24.png\" target=\"_self\">textSpecify the instructions

By requiring specific entanglement patterns, it taught:\nHow quantum gates manipulate qubit states\nHow entanglement creates measurement correlations\nHow to design quantum circuits to achieve specific classical outcomes\nThe importance of local testing before remote execution\nThe challenge successfully demonstrated how quantum entanglement can be leveraged for authentication mechanisms, breaking away from traditional classical approaches.Difficulty Rating: ⭐☆☆☆☆ (Very Easy)\nTime to Solve: 15-30 minutes\nKey Skills Required:\nBasic quantum computing concepts Python scripting Network communication Analytical thinking Files Provided:\nGlobal Hyperlink Zone.zip (2 KB) Contains: server.py (only file needed) Tools Used:\nunzip - for file extraction netcat / nc - for server connection Python 3 - for local testing and automation Basic text editor - for code analysis writing by aladeb0","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Write-up: Global Hyperlink Zone Challenge</strong>","level":1,"id":"**Write-up_Global_Hyperlink_Zone_Challenge**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>1.
