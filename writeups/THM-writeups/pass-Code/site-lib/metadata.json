room is classified as an easy-level challenge under the Blockchain / Web3 category.\nThe objective is straightforward, focusing on interacting with a smart contract to retrieve a single passcode.\nThe room is short, clear, and can be completed in a minimal amount of time.<img alt=\"room-image\" src=\"images/title.png\" target=\"_self\">To begin the challenge, we must first execute all the commands provided in the room exactly as given and in the correct order. These commands are required to initialize the environment, retrieve the necessary values, and interact correctly with the deployed smart contract. Executing them properly allows us to check the contract state and confirm whether the challenge has been solved.\nRPC_URL=http://10.66.180.95:8545 API_URL=http://10.66.180.95 PRIVATE_KEY=$(curl -s ${API_URL}/challenge | jq -r \".player_wallet.private_key\") CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$(curl -s ${API_URL}/challenge | jq -r \".contract_address\") PLAYER_ADDRESS=$(curl -s ${API_URL}/challenge | jq -r \".player_wallet.address\") is_solved=`cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \"isSolved()(bool)\" --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} echo \"Check if is solved: $is_solved\" If you are running this challenge on your own machine (instead of the TryHackMe AttackBox) or if you are connected via VPN, please note that the cast tool is not installed by default.
